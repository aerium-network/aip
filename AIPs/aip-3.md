## Abstract

This proposal introduces a native Layer-1 transaction type for the Aerium
blockchain that enables decentralized intellectual property registration,
ownership tracking, and provenance management without relying on smart
contracts. The system implements a privacy-preserving hash-based proof mechanism
using BLAKE2b cryptographic functions to ensure data integrity while maintaining
confidentiality of asset content. The proposed IP Registry system
supports comprehensive metadata management with optional fields including title,
content type, public links, and file size, while maintaining a mandatory version
control system that creates an immutable chain of ownership and modifications
similar to distributed version control systems.

The implementation leverages cryptographic signatures `(Ed25519/Secp256k1)` to
establish proof of ownership and authenticity, with transaction sizes optimized
to range from `121 bytes` for minimal registrations to `558 bytes` for full
transfers including complete metadata. Unlike existing NFT-based solutions that
require smart contract overhead, this native approach provides superior
performance, lower costs, and enhanced privacy through selective metadata
disclosure. The system addresses key challenges in digital asset management by
providing tamper-proof ownership records, complete version history tracking, and
seamless ownership transfer capabilities while preserving user privacy and
maintaining blockchain efficiency.

This framework establishes a foundation for decentralized intellectual property
management that can serve various use cases including digital art provenance,
software licensing, academic publication tracking, and creative content
ownership verification, positioning Aerium as a blockchain platform specifically
optimized for intellectual property applications.

## Motivation

The exponential growth of digital assets and intellectual property in blockchain
ecosystems has created an urgent need for native, efficient ownership tracking
mechanisms. Current solutions face several critical limitations:

**Privacy vs Transparency Trade-offs**: Traditional blockchain systems offer
complete transparency at the expense of privacy, while full zero-knowledge proof
systems provide maximum privacy but introduce prohibitive computational overhead
unsuitable for high-throughput environments. Neither approach adequately serves
creators who need selective privacy with transparent ownership history.

**Validator Complexity**: Existing solutions require complex validation logic
that strains network resources. The computational overhead of verifying smart
contract states or full zero-knowledge proofs significantly impacts network
performance.

This proposal addresses these challenges by introducing a native Layer-1
transaction type that combines the simplicity of traditional cryptographic
proofs with selective privacy features. Unlike full zero-knowledge systems that
hide all information, our approach enables creators to selectively disclose
metadata while maintaining content privacy through cryptographic hashing.

The proposed system draws inspiration from distributed version control systems
like Git, providing linear versioning with clear ownership transitions. This
familiar paradigm reduces complexity for both implementers and users while
ensuring efficient validation by network participants.

## Specification

This specification formalizes the design and mechanism for three native Layer-1
transaction types dedicated to Intellectual Property (IP) Provenance and
Ownership Tracking on the Aerium blockchain. It ensures efficient, secure, and
privacy-preserving registration, versioning, and transfer of digital assets,
with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and cryptographic integrity.

### Transaction Type Definition

#### Current Aerium Transaction Types

Currently, transactions in Aerium support the following payload types:

- **Transfer Payload** (PayloadType: `1`) - Native token transfers between addresses
- **Bond Payload** (PayloadType: `2`) - Validator staking operations
- **Sortition Payload** (PayloadType: `3`) - Consensus participation mechanism
- **Unbond Payload** (PayloadType: `4`) - Validator unstaking operations
- **Withdraw Payload** (PayloadType: `5`) - Reward withdrawal operations
- **Batch Transfer Payload** (PayloadType: `6`) - Multiple transfers in single transaction

#### New IP Registry Payload Types

This AIP proposes the addition of three new payload types for intellectual property management:

- **IP Register Payload** (PayloadType: `7`) - Initial intellectual property registration
- **IP Update Payload** (PayloadType: `8`) - Content or metadata modification while preserving ownership
- **IP Transfer Payload** (PayloadType: `9`) - Ownership transfer to a new address

This approach provides **zero ambiguity**, **compile-time type safety**, and
**optimal payload sizes** while maintaining **perfect alignment** with Aerium's
existing architecture patterns.

### Payload Size Analysis

| Operation | Fixed Fields | Optional Metadata | Total Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **IP Register** | 121 bytes | 0-372 bytes | 121-493 bytes |

$$
ContentHash = H(FileContent)
$$

### Metadata Hash Calculation

The `MetadataHash` ensures metadata integrity and supports selective disclosure:

$$
MetadataHash = \begin{cases}
H(JSON(Metadata)) & \text{if } Metadata \neq \emptyset \\
0^{32} & \text{if } Metadata = \emptyset
\end{cases}
$$

## Security Considerations

The IP Registry system introduces new attack surfaces and security
considerations beyond standard cryptocurrency transactions. The unique
requirements of intellectual property management—including content integrity,
ownership verification, version control, and selective privacy—necessitate
specialized security analysis and protection mechanisms.

### Hash Function Security

**BLAKE2b-256 Analysis:**

- **Collision Resistance**: `2^128` theoretical collision resistance provides
  adequate security for IP content identification
- **Preimage Resistance**: `2^256` preimage resistance prevents attackers from
  finding content that matches a given hash
- **Performance**: High-speed hashing (~1 GB/s) minimizes computational overhead
  while maintaining security
- **Quantum Resistance**: Post-quantum secure against known quantum algorithms
  (Grover's algorithm reduces security to `2^128`, still adequate)

**Hash Chain Integrity:**

The sequential hash chaining through PreviousHash creates a tamper-evident audit
trail where modification of any historical transaction becomes computationally
infeasible without detection.

### Digital Signature Security

**Ed25519 Security Properties:**

- **Key Security**: 128-bit equivalent security level against classical computers
- **Signature Uniqueness**: Deterministic signatures prevent signature malleability attacks
- **Side-Channel Resistance**: Constant-time implementation prevents timing attacks
- **Quantum Vulnerability**: Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm; requires future upgrade to post-quantum schemes

**ECDSA secp256k1 Compatibility:**

- **Bitcoin Compatibility**: Enables integration with existing Bitcoin/Ethereum infrastructure
- **Security Level**: 128-bit equivalent security with proper implementation
- **Malleability Concerns**: Requires canonical signature encoding to prevent transaction malleability

### Content-Related Attacks
